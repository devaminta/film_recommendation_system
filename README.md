# Film Recommendation System

A content-based film recommendation system built with Python. This system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and cosine similarity to suggest movies based on user preferences.

## Overview

This project is designed to recommend films to users based on their interests by analyzing the similarity between films. It uses **cosine similarity** to compare the features of films, with NLP techniques applied to process and understand film descriptions, genres, or other textual metadata.

### Key Features
- **Content-Based Recommendations**: Recommendations are based on the similarity of content features (e.g., plot, genre, actors).
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the similarity between movie feature vectors to find related films.
- **NLP**: Uses NLP techniques to analyze film descriptions or other text data for better recommendation accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset should include at least:
- Film title
- Genre
- Keywords


These features will be processed and used to build vector representations of each film.

### Sample Dataset Source
You can use open datasets such as:
-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
  

2. **Install dependencies**:
   

3. **Requirements**:
    - Python 3.x
    - Pandas
    - Scikit-learn
    - NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Convert text features (e.g., genres, descriptions) into a format suitable for cosine similarity calculations. For this, we use a **TF-IDF vectorizer** to transform text data into vector representations.

2. **Compute Cosine Similarity**:
   - Generate a similarity matrix using cosine similarity on the vectorized film features. Each movie will have a vector representation, and cosine similarity is used to compare them.

3. **Get Recommendations**:
   - Provide a film title to the recommendation function, and it will return a list of similar films based on content features.
